# Web wait loop (10m max):
# - curl the health endpoint; if no response, sleep and retry.
# - parse .status and .gitSha; if status != ok, sleep and retry.
# - if gitSha is unknown, sleep and retry.
# - if short SHA matches expected, succeed; otherwise log mismatch, sleep, and retry.
# Secondary gate (optional): poll /api/v1/events/poll for 200 (same retry window). Then run prod Playwright.
