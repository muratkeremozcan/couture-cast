#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done

#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic 0 is Sprint 0 infrastructure; must complete before Epic 1
# - Epics 1-6 should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM/Code-Review validates, then Dev moves to 'done'
